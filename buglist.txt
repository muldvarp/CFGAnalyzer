#0:
length is not shown correctly
cfganalyzer -v 3 -a ./../benchmarks/ambiguous/46.cfg
*** ML: easy fix, Sophie could have done that ***

#1:
grammars with different alphabets don't work in intersection mode
*** ML: already fixed? can anybody confirm that the bug still exists? ***


#2:
results of cfganalyzer -v 1 -i ../benchmarks/ambiguous/29.cfg ../benchmarks/simple_tests/test5.cfg
and        cfganalyzer -v 1 -n ../benchmarks/ambiguous/29.cfg ../benchmarks/simple_tests/test5.cfg
are contradictory
*** ML: seemed to be a consequence of #3 below, thus is fixed ***

#3:
nonterminals need to be renamed if more than one grammars is being examined
better: rename variables in the encoding
*** ML: fixed ***

#4:
there seems to be no latex output when run in intersection mode
cfganalyzer -v 1 -n ../benchmarks/ambiguity/29.cfg ../benchmarks/simple_tests/test5.cfg -o parse.tex
