(* variable T(a,i) is used to denote that the i-th letter of the word to be found is `a'
   0 <= i < k, a : alphabet *)

(* variable N(A,i,j,m) represents the occurrence of nonterminal A in table entry (i,j) on level m, 
   0 <= i <= j < k, 0 <= m <= 1 *)

(* variable H(B,C,i,j,h) is used as an auxiliary variable to obtain CNF *)

(* variable B(j) is used as an auxiliary variable to encode the constraints for starting nonterminals in
   the intersection and inclusion problem *)
